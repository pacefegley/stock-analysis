# stock-analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to write a VBA script that can quickly anaylze thousands of stock ticker records in order to calculate a return on investment.

## Results
### 2017:
![Table_AllStocks_2017](https://github.com/pacefegley/stock-analysis/assets/119641907/e5b71fd2-df55-41e8-abe8-21bca75f4ed7)

### 2018:

We can see from the images above that the returns in 2017 were far better than in 2018. 2018 was a pretty rough year for this subset of stocks.

## Summary

- The advantage of refactoring code is that it gives you an opportunity to re-think the decisions you made the first time around. It also allows you optimize diffferent pieces of the code in order to run better on the hardware you;re using.
- The main difference here was the for loop that ran through all of the records. That made the analysis much more efficient.
